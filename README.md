# Colour-Detection-Project
The process of detecting the name of any color in an image is known as color detection.Colours are made up of 3 primary colours: red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each colour value within a range of 0 to 255. So, there are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a colour. This software helps us to find out or extract RGB values and the colour name of a pixel on which you double clicked.The Approach is basic and simple.In this project, we have used python language along with pandas and cv as libraries. To create the user interface which will enable the user to select a point or area such that whenever a double click event occurs, it will update the colour name and RGB values on the window. If the event is double-clicked then we calculate and set the RGB values along with x, y positions of the mouse.
